# IMAGE RECOGNITION OF COUNTRY CURRENCY USING MACHINE LEARNING
## INTRODUCTION:
   + This project is basically an idea to design system which is used for currency recognition.
   + Each country has its own different currency so it is very complicated task for people to recognize the currency.
   + Basis on the survey conducted by Central Intelligent Agency, there are approximately 180 currencies circulating in the world.
   + In this present times the business between countries has increased.
   + There are many Forex banks for money exchanging have to differentiate various types of currencies and that job is not that easy.
   + In whatever way, it is hard to remember and recognize the currency correctly by human. 
   + Here comes the challenge. So, to recognize the currency we need an efficient computerized and automated system.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
   + In current world it is hard to identify and remember the currencies. 
   + People may remember for shorter time as time passes they may forget .
   + So this may cause problems in businesses where people who deals with number of currencies.
   + Hence a computerized method which accurately identifies name of the currency, origin and value of the note without any human interventions.
## EXPLANATION ABOUT THE PROCESS:
   + An image recognition algorithm takes an image ( or a patch of an image ) as input and outputs what the image contains.
   + The task is split mainly into two categories:
       1. Classification of the image to a single category /multiple categories.
       2. Identification of certain objects in an Image 
   + The Input image consists of pixels.

   + We evaluate several input pixel representations including grayscale, RGB and LAB colour spaces optionally with power law (gamma) equalization. 
   + Based on the image resolution, it will see **height * width * dimension**. 
   + E.g., An image of a 6 x 6 x 3 array of a matrix of RGB (3 refers to RGB values) and an image of a 4 x 4 x 1 array of a matrix of the grayscale image.
   + In this Python is one of the most popular programming languages that's heavily used by developers/practitioners for Machine Learning.
   + In this image recognition we use **Numpy** Python library with ndarray to set and modify pixel values, trim images, concatenate images, and many more.
   + **Matplotlib** library is mostly used for 2D visualisations, but it can also be leveraged for image processing.
   + **Scikit image** is one of the top open-source image processing Python libraries for being a collection of algorithms for image processing.
## PERFORMANCE METRICS EXPLANATION:
   + Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithm to enhance the properties of digital images.
